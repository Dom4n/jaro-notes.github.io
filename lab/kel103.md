# Korad KEL102/KEL103 Electronic load
This site was created because I really struggled to understand original manual.  
It will be here.  
Just in case.

# Screen
- `GREP` - back panel trigger is on (`Shift+CR`) ,it can on/off any state or step through sequence or start battery test mode
- `COMM` - back panel sense enabled (`Shift+CW`), display will show voltage at source rather that with drop of cables
- `LOCK` - keyboard is locked (`Shift+.`),  `esc` key will stop output, `OnOff` will toggle output
# Other 
- `Shift+7` will act like short (max A and V will be selected)
- `Shift+8` will show serial number of device

# Memory
## set
- `Shift+2`
- select slot 1 to 100, confirm `Enter`
## recall
- `Call+2`
- select slot 1 to 100, confirm `Enter`
## quick adjust M1-M5
when M1 to M5 is lit adjust value (not mode!) and press Mx again to store
## quick load M1-M5
just press corresponding button

# Set MAX values
- `0-3A` - resolution 0.1mA
- `3-30A` - resolution 1mA
- `0-18V` - resolution 0.1mV
- `18-120V` - resolution 1mV

## setup
- `Shift+CV`
- input A, confirm `Enter`, press `CV` for next setting
- input V, confirm `Enter`, press `CV` for next setting
- input W, confirm `Enter`, press `CV` for next setting
- input R, confirm `Enter`, press `CV` for next setting

# Dynamic test mode
It has 6 setting functions:
- 1 - Dynamic CV
- 2 - Dynamic CC
- 3 - Dynamic CR
- 4 - Dynamic CW
- 5 - Dynamic Pulse
- 6 - Dynamic Flip

## setup for CV, CR, CW
- `Shift+Enter`, input number 1,3,4 to select function above and confirm `Enter`
- input first value
- input second value
- input frequency in Hz
- input duty cycle in %
- `OnOff` will start/pause
## setup for CC timed
- `Shift+Enter`, input 2 and confirm `Enter`
- `2-001 G` - input first current change rate (0.0001-0.3A/us for 3A range; 0.001-1.5A/us in >3A range)
- `2-002 G` - input second current change rate (0.0001-0.3A/us for 3A range; 0.001-1.5A/us in >3A range)
- `2-003 G` - input first current
- `2-004 G` - input second current
- `2-005 G` - input frequency in Hz
## setup for CC toggle manual
When trigger is received output will toggle between first and second value.
- `Shift+Enter`, input 6
- ... rest exactly like in CC timed
Press `3` to toggle between values. Or enable external trigger via `Shift+CR` and toggle via back panel

# List / Sequential mode
Runs a list of predefined values in given order and timing.
## setup
- `Shift+CC`
- `LM001` - memory position of list (1 to 7) `{example 3 - M=03}`
- `LM002` - input max current in A
- `LM003` - input how many steps will be in list (2 to 84) `{example 3 - LI=03}`
- `LM004` - input first current value in A
- `LM005` - input first slope value in A/us
- `LM006` - input first on time value in s
- ... continue inputting current->slope->on_time for each list item
- `LM0013` (13 if we had 3 items in list) - input how many times list should be repeated
## run
- `Call+CC`, select slot created in setup
- `OnOff` to start/pause execution
- display will show how many times list was executed (if it reach repeats set in last setup step load will disable itself)

# Battery test mode
Tests battery discharge, displays consumed Wh and Ah
# setup
- `shift+6`
- `bMM01` - memory position 1 to 10
- `bMM02` - current range (3A for higher resolution)
- `bMM03` - discharge current
- `bMM04` - end-off voltage (test will stop when below set V)
- `bMM05` - end-off capacity (test will end when capacity above set Ah)
- `bMM06` - end-off time (test will end when discharge takes longer that set seconds)
## run
- `call+6`
- select memory position created in previous step

# OCP test mode
Tests CC mode of power supply.
## setup
- `shift+9`
- `CMM01` - memory position 1-10 (MM) `{example 2 - MM=02}`
- `CMM02` - VON voltage
- `CMM03` - time delay after VON has been reached
- `CMM04` - current range in A
- `CMM05` - beginning current in A (higher that ending curr)
- `CMM06` - step current in A
- `CMM07` - reduction time in s
- `CMM08` - ending current in A (lower that beginning curr)
- `CMM09` - OCP voltage
- `CMM10` - max current - ``< beginning current`
- `CMM11` - min current - `> end current`
## run
- `call+9`
- select memory position created in previous step
**positive** test setup:
- power supply set to 22V, 1A
- 10Von, delay 2s
	- waits until input reaches >10V for 2sec
- range is 3A 
	- higher resolution of Korad
- start current 1.2A, end current 0.8A, step 0.1A, reduction time 1s, OCP voltage 20V
	- after start it gets 1.2A, CC kicks in so supply voltage will be <20V
	- 1s reduction time: 1.1A, CC in place
	- 1s reduction time: 1A, CC in place
	- 1s reduction time: 0.9A: CV in place, so output is 0.9A 22V and test ends with positive result
**negative** result will be when in any step above current is lover than ending current or when power supply never reach OCP voltage

# OPP test mode
It's analogue to OCP described above, storage is displayed as PMMSS (where MM is memory slot and SS is step) and instead of setting A*mpers* we set W*atts*.
